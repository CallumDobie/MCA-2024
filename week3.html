        <p>Overall, in a direct comparison, MEI seems to be more flexible in terms of what it can accomplish,
        whereas MusicXML is more strict. However, the strictness of MusicXML means that it is more consistent, and
        the flexibility of MEI can be too complex for non-professionals. For example:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Articulations - In MusicXML articulations are directly integrated with their parent, notations. It also contains
            elements such as staccato, accent and fermata. Notations group all performance-related instructions. In MEI, articulations also
            include the elements fermata and staccato. However, it is more flexible and is not tied to notations as
            MusicXML is; it can be represented as a separate entity.</li>
            <li>Clefs - Again, MusicXML is more rigid. Clefs are tied to their parent, attributes. This means it is tied directly to 
            the measure. Clefs in MEI are part of the staffDef element meaning it defines staves as a whole instead
            of individual measures.</li>
            <li> - Ties in MEI are able to span across staves as they are tied to their parent, note, using unique IDs,
            startid and endid. MusicXML is also tied to note, but it is once again more rigid. It's behaviours include
            start, stop and continue. Without the use of unique IDs that are in MEI, it means that they are more limited.</li>
