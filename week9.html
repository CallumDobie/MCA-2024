	<h1>Week 9 LAb Tasks</h1>
	
	<h2>Task 1</h2>
	
	<p>Foucsing on the previous audios from last week: Why, Juno, and First Love, these are the three aspects generated
	   on SonicVisualizer:</p>
	   
	 <img src="data/week9-why.PNG" width="250";height="250" />
	 <img src="data/week9-juno.PNG" width="250";height="250" />
	 <img src="data/week9-firstlove.PNG" width="250";height="250" />
	 
	 </br>
	 
	 <p>Each image starts with the speectogram, then the melodic frequency, and lastly the chromogram.</p>
	 
	 <h2>Task 2</h2>
	 
	 The following hisrograms are generated using the melodic frequency data, the first being Why:
	 
	<img src="data/why-histo.PNG"  width="500";height="500" /> 
	
	<p>The next being Juno:</p>
	
	<img src="data/juno-histo.PNG"  width="500";height="500" /> 
	
	<p>Lastly being First Love</p>
	
	
	<img src="data/firstlove-histo.PNG"  width="500";height="500" /> 
	
    <p>Overall, the three histograms do capture very similar data. I was quite suprised by this as I tried to select tracks that fell under different genres. However,
	   they are all made by the same artist, Sabrina Carpenter, so it is at the same time unsurprising that she maintains a similar over the course of her music.</p>
