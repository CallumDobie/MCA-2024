<h1>Week 1 Tasks</h1>

<h2>Task 2.</h2>
 <p>I have decided to base my project off of the discography of Sabrina Carpenter, I have yet to decide on which songs in particular to use as I will need to be sure I can find notated versions
of all the songs I plan on using.</p>

<h2>Task 3</h2>
<p>A challenge I have faced, as stated previously, is access to the musical scores of her work. Although I have easily found multiple different usable pieces, not all are so easy to find or have an additional cost to access. This additional cost is one of my main takeaways as a challenge in terms of access to working with music-related data as it limits the amount of people who are able to access and work with the data.
However, I have managed to find sufficient amounts of scores to make the project feesible, and metadata and audio recordings were even less challeging to find. All audio recordings are available on YouTube, Spotify etc.</p>
