  <h1>Week 2 Lab Tasks</h1>
  
  <p>For the most part the score I chose, Bed Chem by Sabrina Carpenter, was transcribed correctly by the OMR engine with only minor faults.
  Some issues that arised in the group work this week were due to the sheet music being old/on yellowed paper. This caused issues for the engine
  when it was transcribing. However, the original PDF of the sheet music I used for this task was clear and therefore was easy for the engine to
  process. Some issues that arose included:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>On the 2nd bar there were no ties between the notes.</li>
    <li>Again on 4th bar there was the same issue.</li>
    <li>On the 5th bar one of the notes was the wrong pitch - Being an F instead of an E.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>As mentioned earlier I believe that it was due to the high quality of the original PDF that there were minimal faults. However, the issues with the ties
  happened frequently across the transcribed piece and seemed to be the biggest issue for the engine. </p>
