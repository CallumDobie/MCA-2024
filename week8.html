	<p>The following waveforms and spectrograms were generated from the tracks:</p>
	
	<img src="data/why-spectrogram.png" height="250";width="250" />
	<img src="data/juno-spectrogram.png" height="250";width="250" />
	<img src="data/firstlove-spectrogram.png" height="250";width="250" />
	
	<p>One advanatage of time-frequency analysis over a waveform based analysis is that time-frequency
	   will reveal how the frequency content changes over time. Where waveform lacks the efficiency of
	   analysing more complex audios such as speech or music, time-frequency can provided detailed 
	   information. It uses analysis techniques, such as spectrograms, where color intensity shows 
	   the frequency or power. This means that multiple aspects of the audio can be analysed simultaneously.
	   As an example, for an audio containing speech data, a spectrogram would detail elements such as harmonics
	   where waveform could only show peaks corresponding to syllables.</p>
